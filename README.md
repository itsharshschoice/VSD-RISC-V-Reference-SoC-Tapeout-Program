***From Design to Silicon with Industry-Grade Tools***

This repository captures my week-by-week progress, documenting each task as I move forward.

## **Introduction**

The **RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program** is a national-level initiative designed to give students, educators, and professionals the most authentic VLSI design experience covering everything from RTL design to actual silicon fabrication (tapeout).  

Through this program, we explore the complete System-on-Chip (SoC) design flow — from RTL to GDSII — using open-source EDA tools. It is a part of India’s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, uniting 3500+ participants to design silicon and contribute to strengthening the nation’s semiconductor ecosystem.

This hands-on program demonstrates the complete ASIC design cycle:  
**RTL→Verification→Physical Design→GDSII→Fabrication→Post-Silicon Validation**

This program is part of India’s Semiconductor Mission to create a new generation of skilled chip designers who don’t just simulate designs—but fabricate them. With the help of Synopsys EDA tools and the SCL180nm PDK, participants gain first-hand exposure to industry-grade flows, learning how to take a design all the way to post-silicon validation. 


## **Project Outcomes**  
- Reusable RTL→GDSII flow with documented constraints and sign‑off artifacts 
- Corner‑clean timing reports (TT/SS/FF), SDF‑annotated GLS logs, and reproducible scripts  
- Tapeout submission package (GDSII + documentation) aligned with SCL requirements
